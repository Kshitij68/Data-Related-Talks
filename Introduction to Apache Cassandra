Why Cassandra (or any non-relational database)?
-> Huge amounts of data
-> Traditional Solutions: (i) Oracle MySQL (ii) Microsoft SQL Server are not best fit
-> Big Table (2006) - Google
-> Dynamo Paper (2007) - Amazon
-> Cassandra (2008) - Distributed of Dynamo and data model of Big Table

Cassandra - More than one server
-> All nodes participate in a cluster
-> Shared nothing
-> Add or remove as needed
-> More capacity? Add a server

Cassandra - Fully replicated
-> Client writes local
-> Data syncs across WAN
-> Replication Factor per DC

Cassandra - Writes on a single node
-> Update in Cassandra is called Mutation
-> When the data arrives to server, it writes in a commit log
-> When data goes in commit log, it puts in mem table (identified by primary key). Mem table represents row of data
-> Acknowledge to the client on the process being completed.
-> As mem tables start to fill up, there is a flush process
->
