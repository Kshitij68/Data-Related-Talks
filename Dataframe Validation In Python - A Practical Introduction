When we work in sandbox/development environment, usually things go pretty smoothly
The problems usually start when model faces with real data in production

Why do we need data validation?
-> We should validate the data the same way we validate the code

Data Quality Dimensions
-> Valid: Proper syntax and format
-> Accurate: Supposed to be representative of real world
-> Complete
-> Consistent
-> Uniform
-> Unique

Four Scenarios can happen on going for production
-> Perfect World:  Everything works as planned. Yay!
-> Model Deterioration: In few days / weeks, there is deterioration in the model performance
-> Accidental Discovery: We have problem with underlying data, which model doesn't indicate as wrong.
                        It takes someone with domain expertise to identify that.
-> Ignorance is bliss: Model is giving wrong predictions even though we do not know that

Tool 1: voluptous
Tool 2: Engarde


TDDA: Test Driven Data Analysis
Applying TDDA principals to data analysis
Benefits:-
-> Correctness
-> Regression Detection
-> Refactoring
-> Portability
