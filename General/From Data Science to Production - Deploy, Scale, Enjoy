The Early Days of Startups
-> You don't focus on reliability
-> You don't focus on scalability
Problem Defination:
-> Many different technologies
-> Hard to reproduce data science results
-> Issues with backward compatibility
-> Dependency hell
-> Hard to scale products
-> Hard to on-board new people
Some tips:
-> Use Version Control
-> Cover Code with Tests
-> Thorough Documentation

Docker
-> Still have a host machine
