What is the next big thing in the Industry?

We stand on threshold of Renaissance on programming languages

The world did not stop with the invention of Object Oriented Programming languages
There was a huge interest in functional programming languages

Historically programming language world has been broken down into two two distinct camps
- Practioners: Who want to get shit done
- Academics: Exploring new ideas

What academicians create does not always get used or appreciated by practioners. 
There is no feedback loop.

Academicians do not get the feedback of practioners.
Practioners do not get to use the ideas and works by academicians

That means programming language research has been done by academicians only

Virtualization
Virtualization helps programmers because now the "low-level" details can be easily ignored
This allows programmers to focus on the programming

Tools
IDEs, Analyzers, Debuggers, Profilers

Linguistics
