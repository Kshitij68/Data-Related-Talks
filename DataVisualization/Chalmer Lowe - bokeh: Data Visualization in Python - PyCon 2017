There are two faces of Bokeh
-> Standalone visualizations viewable in browsers with no use of Bokeh server
-> These plots have interactive tools and features, such as panning, brushing, hover, etc.

Server-based apps
-> Environment where data can be updated and manipulated such that it can then update the visualization and where the user interface and selection process can trigger visual updates

How does Bokeh work?
-> Bokeh is designed such that high-level objects that go into your model are created in Python and converted to JSON format
-> Bokeh JS uses this to create the visualizations which are rendered in JavaScript to the browser
-> Limitations: Displaying large quantities of data is limited by the browser and its ability. We will look at using Bokeh server to get around this
