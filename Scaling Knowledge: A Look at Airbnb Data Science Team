Case #1: Marginal Return
I have X$ to increase my supply in Europe. In which markets should I invest?
B = A*S^y*D^a
B => Bookings
A => Matching Efficiency Parameter (How easy it is to convert supply demand to bookings)
S => Supply
y => Elasticity of Supply
D => Demand
a => Elasticity of Demand

Case #2: Experiments
We deployed a feature. Bookings increased. 
We cannot make any such conclusions directly as we do not know about the world without feature

Case #3: Data Products
