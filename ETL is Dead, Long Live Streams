Data and data systems have really changed in the past decade

Old World: Two popular locations for data
Operational Databases and Relational data warehouse

Major Trends:
    (i) Single server databases are replaced by a myriad of distributed data platforms that operate at company wide scale
    (ii) Many more types of data sources beyond transactional data-logs, sensors, metrics etc.
    (iii) Stream data is increasingly ubiquitous, need for faster processing than daily
    (iv) The end result? The data pipelines have become increasingly complex

We will see how transitioning to streams cleans up the mess and works towards a more structured, scalable and manageable approach

A short history of data integration

ETL tools:-
    (i) The need for global schema
    (ii) Data cleansing and curation is manually and fundamentally error-prine
    (iii) Operational Cost of ETL is high; it is slow, time and resource intensive
    (iv) ETL tools were built to narrowly focus on connecting databases and the data warehouse in a batch fashion

Early take on real-time ETL = Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)
Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)
    - EAI employed enterprise service buses and MQs; weren't scalable

ETL and EAI are outdated
    - EAI: Real time but not scalable
    - ETL: Scalable but batch

Complete Revamp is required to create a technology that suits the modern technology world. Their are new set of requirements:-
    - Ability to process high-volume and high-diversity data
    - Real-time from the grounds up; a fundamental transition to event-centric thinking
