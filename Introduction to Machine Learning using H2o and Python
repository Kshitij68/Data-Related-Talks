H2O is easy to use as one can do advanced stuff using simple API. 

H20 is in-memory, distributed machine learning algorithms giving high speed and accuracy

This tutorial is about H20 Machine Learning platform
Other products:
-> Deep Water: On using GPU for Deep Learning
-> Sparkling Water: Intergration with Spark
-> Steam: Having deploy a model

H2O is much faster for Big Data with same (or better) performance
High Performance
Scalable
Powerful

H2O
-> Has connectors to databases including HDFS, S3, NFS, Local, SQL

The Engine Comprises of 4 parts
-> Part-1: (i) Load Data (ii) Distributed In-Memory (iii) Loss-less compresion
-> Part-2: (i) Exploratory & Descriptive Analysis (ii) Feature Engineering & Selection
-> Part-3: (i) Supervised & Unsupervised Modeling (ii) Model Evaluation & Selection
-> Part-4: (i) Predict (ii) Data & Model Storage

The Output allows the data and model to be exported as plain old java object to the production scoring environment

H20 has a web interface. It has most of the features inlcuding data ingesting, data manipulation, model building and model scoring.

Learning Objectives:
-> Start and Connect to a local H2o cluster in Python
-> Import data from Python data frames, local files or web
-> Perform basic data transformation and exploration
-> Train regression and classification models
-> Evaluate models and make predictions
-> Improve performance by tuning and stacking
-> Connect to H2O cluster in the cloud

-> Do import h2o and then h20.init(nthreads = -1) # -1 will automatically use all the clusters available in your machine
-> Import CSV file using H2O dataframe
-> Convert Pandas dataframe to H20 Dataframe
